SRT Combiner
============

Ever had downloaded a movie that is split into two files and includes two subtitle files? well if you're like me you'll want to merge the two parts into one, there are plenty of tools out there for doing this to the movie files, but there's not much out there for merging the subtitle files together. This utility does just that, it takes two .srt subtitle files and merges them into one!
